## Background & Purpose
The webpage created during this analysis enables users to search for and view sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) around the world. Using the filter criteria, users can personalize UFO sighting search results by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

To filter the search results, type a value into any of the search criteria inputs and press Enter. The table of results to the right will automatically filter based on the values entered. For instance, a search for UFO sightings in California on January 1, 2010 would yield the following:

![CA_01012010](https://github.com/amberteets/UFOs/blob/main/ca_01012010.png)

A search for UFOs in the shape of a circle would yield the following:

![Circle](https://github.com/amberteets/UFOs/blob/main/circle.png)

# Summary
One drawback of the current design is that end users of the webpage must enter search criteria on their own, without knowing the available options for each category. For future iterations, a drop-down menu of available options (e.g. cities, states, shapes, etc.) that are present in the data would be useful to avoid fruitless searches. In addition, the option to filter results as you search, instead of needing to press 'Enter' at the end of a search term, would be advantageous to end users.
